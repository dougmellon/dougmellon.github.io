Welcome to my [now log](https://nownownow.com/about). Think of it as a happy medium between ~~Twitter~~ Threads and a full
blog post that outlines my current focus. There will be a ton of spelling errors and rambling so strap in.

## July 2023
This year may have been the most productive yet hectic year of my life. It kicked off with two weeks working out of the Geneva office, followed by a month of traveling between Paris, Florence, Rome, Capri, and Amalfi. It was an overloaded vacation of great wine, fresh food, boat rides, and plenty of stress but was a trip to celebrate as it's where my now fiance and I met nearly nine years ago. Oh yeah, we got engaged in Crested Butte over the Fourth of July weekend!

We also took to the high seas with a trip from Seattle up into Alaska and eventually caught a ride up into the Yukon. It was a great experience, and a dream come true for Anna, but we left with a deeper appreciation for our hometown of [Estes Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estes_Park,_Colorado).
